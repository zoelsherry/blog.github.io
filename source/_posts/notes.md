As to the **weak form** and **strong form** appear in some paper, first of all, we introduce some simply explain.

1. A strong form of governing equations along with boundary conditions states the conditions at every point over a domain that a solution must satisfy.
2. On the other hand a weak form states the conditions that the solution must satisfy in an integral sense. However, a weak form does not imply "inaccuracy" or "inferiority". And variational formulations or weighted residual formulations.
